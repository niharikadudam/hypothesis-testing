# hypothesis-testing
After conducting the hypothesis test:

Null Hypothesis (ho): The sample mean is equal to the theoretical mean.
Alternative Hypothesis (ùêªa): The sample mean is significantly different from the theoretical mean.
Results
The calculated test statistic (t-value) is compared to the critical value at a 95% confidence level.
If the test statistic exceeds the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis, indicating a significant difference. Otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning there isn‚Äôt enough evidence to claim a significant difference.
